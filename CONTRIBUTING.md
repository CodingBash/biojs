# Contributing

We'd love for you to contribute to our source code and to make BioJS even better than it is
today! Here are the tips for you to make an awesome contribution.

 - [How to contribute](#howto)
 - [Issues and Bugs](#issue)
 - [Feature/Component requests](#feature)
 - [Submission guidelines](#submission)

## <a name="howto"></a> How to contribute?

Here are some general ideas:

* Browse our [issue list][issue] (or [all BioJS repositories][issue_all]) for ideas
* Propose your own ideas
* Ask on gitter or our mailing list

Your contribution could be:

1. Improve an existing component and send a pull request (see the BioJS registry)
2. Create your own component (see the [wishlist][wishlist] if you don't have an own idea)
3. Help us at building the infrastructure (registry, docs, ...)

## <a name="issue"></a> Found an Issue?

If you find a bug in the source code or a mistake in the documentation, you can help us by
submitting an issue to our [GitHub Repository][github]. Even better you can submit a Pull Request
with a fix.

## <a name="feature"></a> Want a Feature/Component?

You can request a new feature by submitting an issue to our [GitHub Repository][github].  If you
would like to implement a new feature or component then consider what kind of change it is.

## <a name="submission"></a> Submission Guidelines

Before you submit your issue search the archive, maybe your question was already answered.

* Search [GitHub](https://github.com/biojs/biojs/issues?q=) for an open or closed issue or pull request
  that relates to your submission. You don't want to duplicate effort.
* If your issue appears to be a bug, and hasn't been reported, open a new issue.

Help us to maximize the effort we can spend fixing issues and adding new
features, by not reporting duplicate issues.  Providing the following information will increase the
chances of your issue being dealt with quickly:

* **Overview of the Issue** - if an error is being thrown a non-minified stack trace helps
* **Motivation for or Use Case** - explain why this is a bug for you
* **Related Issues** - has a similar issue been reported before?
* **Suggest a Fix** - if you can't fix the bug yourself, perhaps you can point to what might be
  causing the problem (line of code or commit)

That's it! Thank you for your contribution!
